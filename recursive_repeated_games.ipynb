    "A *game* consists of\n",

    "A *Nash equilibrium* is a collection of actions that pass the following test: the action of each player gives that player the highest payoff, taking as given the actions of all other players.\n",
    "\n",
    "### A Repeated Game\n",
    "\n",
    "A *repeated game* in discrete time consists of\n",
    "  * A game replayed by the same players at a sequence of dates $t =0, 1, \\ldots, T$, where $T$ might be infinity\n",
    "  * A common discount rate at which all players discount future payoffs\n",
    "  * For each player a *strategy* in the form of a sequence of functions; the time $t$ component of this sequence  prescribes an action at time $t$ as a function of information available to that player at $t$\n",

For good reasons, we will be tempted to iterate to convergence on this operator.  \n",

    "\n",
    "Judd, Yeltekin, Conklin (2003) simplify a candidate value set by *convexifying* it.  This can be accomplished  with **public randomization**\n",
    "\n",
    "Public randomization enables players to coordinate by making their actions depend on a commonly observed public signal. For example: At the beginning of every period every player observes a realization of a uniform random variable with domain on the interval $[0,1]$. If the realization is less than 0.5, then the players take some previously agreed upon action while if the number is greater than 0.5 then they each take a (possibly different) previously specified action. This device ensures the convexity of value sets. If players can achieve $V = (v_1, v_2)$ and $W = (w_1, w_2)$, then  public randomization lets players achieve any value $Z = \\lambda V + (1-\\lambda) W$.\n",
    "\n",
    "In line with our example, one can think of  $\\lambda$ as a probability of an event that leads players to choose  SPE actions with  value $V$, while the complement of $\\lambda$ is an event that prompts  SPE actions with value $W$.\n",

    "A key recommendation of JYC 2003 is a way to approximate the set of subgame perfect equilibrium values. \n",
    "\n",
    "As mentioned above, we use public randomization to assure that sets are convex.\n",
    "\n",
    "A convenient property of convex sets (polytopes in particular) is that  because we only need to keep track of extreme points, they can be represented easily inside a computer. This is referred to as the vertice representation.\n",

    "It is also useful to recognize that polytopes could also be represented as the intersection of a finite number of half-spaces.\n",
    "\n",
    "The algorithm will mostly represent sets in the half-space representation, but we mention the vertice representation because that is typically how we envision (and display) sets.\n",
    "\n",
    "We can describe a set using half-spaces in the following way: Consider a set of subgradients (think about these as directional vectors) $H$. For example, let $H = \\{ (1, 0), (0, 1), (-1, 0), (0, -1) \\}$. Let $C$ be a set of hyperplane levels, for example,  $C = \\{4, 3, 2, 1\\}$. The halfspace corresponding to a specific subgradient, $h \\in H$, and hyperplane level, $c \\in C$, is described by the set $s = \\{ (x, y) | h \\cdot (x, y) \\leq c \\}$. In our example, the set of half-spaces would be $S = \\{s_1, s_2, s_3, s_4\\}$, where\n",

In particular, note that the hyperplane of the half-space is orthogonal to its corresponding subgradient -- The subgradient determines the slope and orientation of the set (whether it lies to the left, right, above, or below the hyperplane). The hyperplane level determines the location of the hyperplane -- It expresses how far from the origin the hyperplane lies.

Therefore, values are bounded above by a player's maximum possible payoff and bounded below by a player's minimum possible payoff. It is infeasible for a player to receive a value smaller (or bigger) than this, and so, using our circle as a starting point, we can crop the size of this set along those values. We use this information (though it isn't necessary) in the function that generates an initial set for our iteration process. This set has to be \"big enough,\" but the bigger the set is the longer it takes to compute the equilibrium value set. There is a tradeoff between ensuring that our set is big enough and saving computation time.\n",

Because $v_1$ and $v_2$ are values obtained as extreme points from the outer hyperplane approximation, they use no public randomization. The linear programming algorithm that produces the outer hyperplane approximation  computes pairs $(a_1, v_1')$, $(a_2,v_2')$ that attain these $v$'s.\n",
