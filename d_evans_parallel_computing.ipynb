    "When boiled down to its basics there are two types of parallel computing environments: Shared Memory Multiple Processors (SMMP) and Distributed Memory Multiple Processors.  SMMP will be the parallel environment most people are familiar with.  Nearly all computers today have two or more processors sharing the same memory.  Languages like C,C++ and Fortran can use OpenMP to quickly parallelize for loops in and SMMP environment.  In addition many numpy operations such as `.dot` are compiled to take advantage of parallel code in the BLAS matrix libraries.  Shared memory environments are generally easier to write parallel code for: in many cases it can be as simple as adding `#parfor` to a for loop.  There is a limit, however to the number of processors that can share the same memory and eventually we have to move on to a distributed memory environment."

    "In a DMMP environment each computational node has its own memory and the nodes are linked together through a network.  As the memory for the nodes are separate, they need to communicate periodically to work on a joint project.  There are multiple ways to handle this communication, for this lecture we will focus on two: MPI which can be accessed through the python library `mpi4py` and IPython parallel.  At the heart of the python language is the GIL, or Global Interpreter Lock, this allows only one thread to access the memory of the python program at a point in time.  This effectively requires python code to be parallelized using DMMP techniques.  This may seem like a disadvantage, but in reality most economic applications are so easily parallelized that the overhead of using MPI is negligible."

The way that an object is sent via mpi4py is that it is first pickled, which converts the python object to a string.  The string is a then sent to the other processes which then convert it back into its original form.  This makes `mpi4py` very flexible.  Nearly all objects in python are picklable, including most user defined classes, which means that most objects can be communicated from one object to another.  In some cases, such as classes defined with Cython, it may be necessary to tell python how to pickle and unpickle an object, but these are generally outside normal usage.\n",

If your program relies on frequent communication between processes it may be worth it to use versions of `gather` and `allgather` designed for numpy arrays.  When these are used Python no longer pickles the object and instead shares the numpy array data directly.  We discuss these in the next section."

    "It will print out the value after one iteration for an agent with $(a,z) = (1,0)$ and $(1,1)$, respectively.  All of this code is written just as it would be for serial execution and we won't go into detail into the precise nature of the code.  Instead, we will focus on how to parallelize the solution of the Bellman Equation.  The key step is approximating the current value function $T(V)$ via interpolation.  We proceed by creating a grid over the $(a,z)$ space (with more points placed where the value function has greater curvature."
